# greek cipher

## Description
You think you've seen all of the "classic" ciphers? Instead of your standard cipher, I've created my own cipher: the monoalphagreek cipher!

Answer with just the flag in lowercase with symbols left in.

## Solution
We are provided a text and the encoded flag written with greek alphabet. To decode it, i changed the greek alphabet to the latin alphabet. Then, use an online frequency attack solver (or do it manually).

## Flag
