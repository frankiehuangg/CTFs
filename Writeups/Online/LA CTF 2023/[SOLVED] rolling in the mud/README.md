# rolling in the mud

## Description
uugh, these pigs in my pen are making a complete mess! They're _rolling_ all over the place!

Anyway, can you decode this cipher they gave me, almost throwing it at me while rolling around?

Answer in lowercase with symbols. In the image, { and } are characters that should appear in your flag, and replace spaces with `_`.

## Solution
The cipher is encoded in a pigpen cipher. To decode, we first decode it from a pigpen cipher, then reverse it followed by a substitution cipher.

## Flag
```txt
lactf{rolling_and_rolling_and_rolling_until_the_pigs_go_home}
```
