# chinese-lazy-theorem-1

## Description
I heard about this cool theorem called the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but, uh... I'm feeling kinda tired right now.

`nc lac.tf 31110`

## Solution
Since we have the integers p and q and the modulus is not bounded, we can get the integer `target` as it ranges from 1 to n.
