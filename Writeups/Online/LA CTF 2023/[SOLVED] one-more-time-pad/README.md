# one-more-time-pad

## Description
I heard the onetime pad is perfectly secure so I used it to send an important message to a friend, but now a UCLA competition is asking for the key? I threw that out a long time ago! Can you help me recover it?

## Solution
Since 

$$
pt ^ key = ct
$$

Then

$$
pt ^ ct =  pt ^ pt ^ key = 0 ^ key = 0
$$
