## Description
-~-~-~-~[]? -~-~-~-~[].

## Solution
For some weird reason, javascript treats `[]` as 0, `-~[]` as 1, `~-~-[]` as 2, and so on. To decode, i use a python script to change it to numbers, and for the right operand i treat 0 as A, 1 as B and so on. Running the script, we will get the flag.
