## Description

```text
The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!

Connect to the program with netcat:

$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52681

The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded here.

    Try passing in things the program doesn't expect. Like a string instead of a number.
</details>

## Solution

In the `data_read` function the value of `empty_number` is set to a value of long-converted string. Entering a string without numbers will make the value of `empty_number` zero, which makes the program prints out the stack.
