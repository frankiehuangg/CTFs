# Extended GCD

## Description

Using the two primes `p = 26513, q = 32321`, find the integers `u,v` such that

`p * u + q * v = gcd(p,q)`

Enter whichever of `u` and `v` is the lower number as the flag.

## Solution

We need to find the value of either $$u$$ or $$v$$, using the extended GCD algorithm. I used one available from GeeksforGeeks and got the number.
